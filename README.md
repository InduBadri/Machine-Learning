Predicting whether a customer will churn or not in Telecommunication industry.
This dataset is from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

In this project, I have deployed the below steps.
1. Descriptive statistics
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Model Building using Cross-validation 

      a. Random Forest
      
      b. Decision Tree Classifier
      
      c. Knn Classifier
      
      d. Logistic Regression
      
      e. SVM
      
 4. Balanced the dataset using SMOTE and applied Logistic Regression.
